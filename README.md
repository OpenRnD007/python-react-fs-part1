# React Fullstack with Python and PostgreSQL (Part - 1)

This project is a full-stack application using React for the frontend and Python with PostgreSQL for the backend. The frontend loads a static JSON file and displays the information in 5 cards.

## Directory Structure

The project follows a structured directory layout to ensure easy navigation and maintenance:

```
src/
|-- components/       # Shared components across features
|   |-- Button
|   |-- Image
|   |-- ...
|-- features/         # Each feature has its own subdirectory
|   |-- FeatureA/
|       |-- components/  # Components specific to FeatureA
|       |-- hooks/       # Hooks specific to FeatureA
|       |-- utils/       # Utility functions for FeatureA
|       |-- FeatureA.js  # Entry point for FeatureA
|       |-- ...
|   |-- FeatureB/
|       |-- ...
|-- hooks/            # Shared hooks
|-- utils/            # Shared utility functions
|-- App.tsx           # Main application setup

```

## Tech Stack

This project uses a widely adopted and versatile tech stack:

•  [**Vite + React + TypeScript**](https://vitejs.dev/): For a fast and type-safe development experience.

•  [**TailwindCSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/): For utility-first CSS styling.

•  [**Zustand**](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/): A small, fast, and scalable bearbones production ready state management solution.


## Advanced React Concepts

The following advanced React concepts are utilized:

•  [**React Hooks**](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks): For component lifecycle and state management.

•  [**Custom Hooks**](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks):

    `useSetShipmentListing`: For handling shipment listings.

    `useEscapeKeyDown`: For escape button event handling.

•  [**Higher-Order Components (HOC)**]():

    `withMainLayout`: For common layout across the application.

•  [**State Management Store**](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/):

    `useStore` (Zustand): For global state management.


## Third-Party Libraries

•  `react-hooks-use-modal`: For modal dialog management.

•  `react-sortablejs`: For sortable list components.


## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenRnD007/python-react-fs-part1.git

```

## Note on Testing
`Cypress` is typically used for component and end-to-end testing in my projects. However, to keep the project straightforward and not over-engineered, it has not been included. If interested, I can provide examples of my work with Cypress through blogs and repositories.
